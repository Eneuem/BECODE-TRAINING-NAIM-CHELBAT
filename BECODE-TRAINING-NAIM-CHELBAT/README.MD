## * <p style="color:red">My fears</p>

- I was a little worried about being too old to understand & learn new things, **I guess I was wrong** ... at least the first three days showed me that i wasn't right ... for now 
- I studied law years ago, after completing my cursus **I was disgusted by it**. Tbf I know it wouldn't happens here cause it's one of the only things I do by passion !

## * 3 Things I find important to work as a team 

- **Resepectful** co-workers, I ve been doing too many jobs in my life, and I know for fact that the worst things is being with people that doesn't value you as a human, **we don't need to be friend, just to communicate politely.**
- A **well divided work**, where people are doing what we are looking from them, again I m speaking about experiences !
- A **fair and skilled leader** that is doing **his part of the job** as the others co-worker
